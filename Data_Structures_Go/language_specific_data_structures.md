- The Go programming language has been rapidly adopted by developers for building web applications. 
With its impressive performance and ease of development, Go enjoys the support of a wide variety of open source 
frameworks for building scalable and highly performant web services and apps. The migration to Golang has taken place
mainly because of its fast, lightweight, and inbuilt concurrency features. This brings with it the need to learn data 
structures and algorithms with this growing language.

- In data structures, a collection of elements of a single type is called an array. Slices are similar to arrays except 
that they have unusual properties. Slice operations such as enlarging a slice using append and copy methods, assigning 
parts of a slice, appending a slice, and appending a part of a slice are presented with code samples. Database operations 
and CRUD web forms are the scenarios in which Go data structures and algorithms are demonstrated.
